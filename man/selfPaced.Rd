\title{Self-Paced Clustering Ensemble (SPCE) Algorithm}
\usage{
selfPaced(SList, K, threshold = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{SList}{A list of \verb{n x n} co-association matrices, each representing a base clustering.
Each matrix contains values between 0 and 1 indicating the co-occurrence likelihood of samples.}

\item{K}{An integer specifying the number of clusters to form.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric hyperparameter value (default = 0.5) controlling the sparsity of the output. Larger values enforce stricter sparsity.}
}
\value{
A vector of cluster assignments for each sample, with length equal to the number of rows (samples) in the input matrices.
Each element is an integer from 1 to \code{K}, indicating the cluster assignment of the corresponding sample.
}
\description{
Implements the SPCE algorithm described in the paper \emph{Self-Paced Clustering Ensemble} by Zhou et al. (2020).
The algorithm integrates multiple base clusterings into a consensus clustering using a self-paced learning strategy.
