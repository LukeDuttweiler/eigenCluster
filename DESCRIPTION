Description: Implements a consensus clustering algorithm from a co-association matrix based on eigendecomposition. The method does not require the investigator to choose a target number of clusters, and is capable of picking a clustering not identified in the creation of the co-association matrix. Full details to be specified in a forthcoming paper.
